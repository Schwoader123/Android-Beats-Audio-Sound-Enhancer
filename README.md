# Android-Beats-Audio-Sound-Enhancer
A sound enhancer for Android; revives the old "Beats Audio" mod for non-HTC phones


This app is simply a rebirth of the "Beats Audio" mod for Android; which, back in the day, installed drivers and profiles that were on the OS on HTC phones containing Beats Audio, back when Beats and Monster were together. This app brings that mod back, but with no root required. The app enhances sound and slightly increases bass, which is what the original Beats Audio software did on HTC phones. This was done by applying Audio Effects on the global audio output mix (yes, I am aware session ID "0" is deprecated, but Google never replaced it, can still be used, and is still widely used by equalizer apps on the Play Store today). I wanted to get that Beats Audio feel back, not only for a slightly better Hip-Hop audio experience, but also have that feeling of having such a feature, just like during the Monster/HTC days. This app was made purely for fun.
